## [3.1.1](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent/tree/3.1.1) (2014-04-26)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent/compare/3.1.0...3.1.1)

The major feature in this version is the ability to translate urls; Meaning a page can have a urlsegment in
a user's native language. This version however requires Silverstripe CMS version 3.1.1 at least, and 3.1.0 
does not include this ability. No changes other than upgrading are required, as the URLSegment exclusion
to translated fields has been removed from the default `SiteTree.field_exclude` config.

Additional options for handling redirection on the homepage were added to tweak home page SEO. By default
the `Fluent.remember_locale` config is set to true, and will attempt to redirect users from the home page
to their last remembered locale. If this interferes with behaviour of your website you should set this to false.

An icon for all translated fields is now added in the CMS. In order to make sure that this appears correctly
for all dataobject fields, it's necessary to make sure that you utilise the `DataObject::beforeUpdateCMSFields`
method to ensure you have added any custom fields prior to extensions running `updateCMSFields`.

There is a new API for users to customise the visibility of pages in the menu. You can now add the
`FluentMenuExtension` extension to `SiteTree` to extend the single `Show In Menu` checkbox into
a list of options allowing visibility setting for each locale.

Also for users who wish to disable translation for a dataobject, you may now explicitly set the string value
of 'none' to the `translate` config for any dataobject, rather than having an empty array.
